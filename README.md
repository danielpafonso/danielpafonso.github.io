## Quote file format

The Quotes file is a `|` seperated file (dsv) with the following fields:

| Field             | Description                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| date              | Publish date                   |
| quote             | Quote itself                   |
| author            | Quote's Author                 |
| birth-death       | Author's birth and death years |
| profession        | Author's Profession            |

Only the date files have a required format, `YYYY-MM-DD` that is used to calculate the quote of the day. This enables the preentive addition of quotes to the files and only will be added on that day.
